	<h1>About Me</h1>

	<p>I'm from East New York, Brooklyn, born and raised. On the the schoolyard is where I spent most of my days. Chillin', maxin', relaxin' all cool, and playing with my barbies outside of school.</p>

	<p>But on a serious note, I'm a Brooklynite in my 20's and I'm entering the field of web development. I studied Creative Writing and Media Journalism in college and I graduated with a bachelor's degree in English. After undergrad, I took on some jobs in admin assitance and I hated it. So, I went back to school and got my real estate license. I did that for a long time and I was unhappy with it, so I went into legal real estate assistance, and I hated that too. I had an ephihany about coding and here I am now, taking the intensive course at <a href="http://nycda.com/" target="_new">New York Code + Design Academy</a>.</p>
	<p>I like smoothies, gummy candies, avocados and all everything in Trader Joe's. I love Brooklyn and I love to travel. My favorite colors are blue, red and black. I like to "Netflix and chill"... by myself.Every year, I have to do three things:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Go someplace I've never been to before</li>
		<li>Do something I've never done before</li>
		<li>See a show/concert</li>
	</ol>

	<p>I've been very successful with this list thus far. </p>
