	<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

	<h3>Why get into Programming?</h3>

	<p>Why not? I was always intrigued by it, but I honestly didn't think it was something that was for me. I played with HTML and CSS, but I didn't think it was something I wanted to invest in, until now.</p>

	<h3>What changed your mind?</h3>

	<p>My boyfriend was studying programming religiously, and he hinted that I should learn some basic code to make my resume pop. But, it wasn't until I was at work one day and hearing my coworkers complain about being overworked and underpaid that I had an ephihany. Why would I want to just be someone's assistant and take their crap when I can become a creator of something amazing? Why just be ordinary, when I can be great? That day, I started looking up code schools.</p>

	<h3>What happened to your job?</h3>

	<p>I started plotting my exit since the day I had my ta-da moment. I applied for NYCDA, got in and left my job shortly after. Then I went to Denver.</p>

	<h3>Do you even like Programming?</h3>

	<p>So far, it's a love-hate relationship. I love that I can create websites and style them. It's an art. I hate that it can be so damn difficult to learn. Damn you Javascript and your stupid functions! Curse your syntax!</p>

	<h3>Any regrets?</h3>

	<p>I wish I started much earlier. But, there's no day like today to learn something new!</p>

	<h3>How do you feel about the future of web development?</h3>

	<p>It's big, bright and beautiful and it's expanding. It's a great time to get into programming because startups are popping up everywhere and creative juices are flowing. I'm happy to be apart of this Big Bang of coding. The future is definitely bright.</p>

	<h3>Why do you like avocados so much?</h3>

	<p>Only God knows why... only God know why.</p>
